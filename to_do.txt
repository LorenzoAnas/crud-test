3.4 Implement REST API Endpoints
Consider using Django Rest Framework for a more structured approach to creating APIs.
Install it using pip install djangorestframework.
Create serializers in myapp/serializers.py for the Task model.
Modify the views to use the serializers and return API responses.
Step 4: Frontend Development with React
4.1 Creating React Components
In your React application, create components for displaying tasks, and a form for adding/updating tasks.
For instance, create components like TaskList.js and TaskForm.js.
4.2 Implementing CRUD Operations in React
In TaskForm.js, implement a form to submit new tasks. Use React state to manage form inputs.
In TaskList.js, fetch tasks from the Django backend and display them. You can use useEffect to load tasks when the component mounts.
4.3 Interacting with the Django Backend
Use Axios or the Fetch API in your React components to make HTTP requests to your Django backend.
For example, to add a new task, send a POST request to the endpoint you defined in Django.
Handle responses and update the React state accordingly.
4.4 CORS Configuration
To enable communication between your React and Django applications, you'll likely need to handle CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) issues.
You can do this by installing django-cors-headers using pip install django-cors-headers and configuring it in your Django project settings.
This completes the basic setup for your backend and frontend. The Django application will manage data and business logic, serving as an API for your React frontend. The React application will present a user interface for interacting with that data. Remember to run both Django and React development servers to test the application.
